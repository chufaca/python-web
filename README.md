After python and flask are [installed (mac version)](https://gist.github.com/dineshviswanath/af72af0ae2031cd9949f), just execute
```console
foo@bar:~$ FLASK_APP=service.py flask run
```
And later just test it with
```console
foo@bar:~$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
U should get
```console
Hello World!
```
